# text-recognition
The process of transforming handwritten text into a machine-readable format is
known as handwritten text recognition (HTR). In a variety of industries, including
finance, education, healthcare, and others, this can be a beneficial tool. Popular
programming language Python
Data preprocessing, visualisation, and analysis can be done using a variety of
libraries, including the language used to create HTR models and pandas,
matplotlib, and seaborn.
Creating a collection of handwritten text samples is the first stage in creating an
HTR model. Once the dataset is prepared, the information is preprocessed to
extract recognition-relevant variables including line spacing, letter width, and pen
pressure. Pandas can be used to load, clean, and transform data into a format
that is appropriate for the model's training and testing.
Next, machine learning technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and recurrent neural networks are used to train the HTR model (RNNs).
The performance and accuracy of the trained model are then measured using a
validation dataset. Once trained, the model can be used to read handwritten text.
The matplotlib and seaborn libraries can be used to evaluate and visualise the
results. During model training, these libraries offer a variety of visualisation tools
to show the model's accuracy, loss, and other metrics. Additionally, they can be
used to visualise the distribution of samples of handwritten text, which can be
useful for spotting patterns and trends in the data.
In conclusion, creating an HTR model in Python with the use of tools like pandas,
matplotlib, and seaborn can be a useful method of transforming handwritten text
into a format that is machine readable. The model may be trained to reliably
recognise a variety of handwritten text samples with the right data preprocessing,
machine learning, and visualisation techniques
